# CS_300

# What was the problem you were solving in this project for this course?
This course was all about learning data structures, the differences between them, and how to manipulate/use them.
The 3 we learned were linked lists, hash tables, and binary search trees.

# How did you approach the problem? Consider why data structures are important to understand.
I approached the problem of using data structures by refering back to our course material and learning how the structure is set up in code.
Understanding how they work is something I strived to do.

# How did you overcome any roadblocks you encountered while going through the activities or project?
My main method was first to take a step back from the problem. Clearing my head always helps me think a bit more straight.
From there, either I would see the error in my thinking, or I would refer to course material or look up on the web for examples similar to the problem I was trying to solve.

# How has your work on this project expanded your approach to designing software and developing programs?
It has expanded my approach by teaching me to have more patience with myself when I code. I did get stuck multiple times when working on the final project, so I would take a step back and look at the bigger picture.

# How has your work on this project evolved the way you write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable?
Because this was the longest program I've written so far, it was taught me how important it is to explain in the code what the code does.
Leaving notes is much more for yourself as the developer, as much as it is to someone else reading your code.
